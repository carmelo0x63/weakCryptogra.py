# Weak Cryptography
They say, (deep voice) "Never roll your own cryptography!". And that's [right](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/amateurs_produc.html)!
Except for one thing, how does one learn if (s)he's not allowed to make mistakes?

`weakCryptogra.py` is a collection of **weak** ciphers, of debatable (if any) usefulness, whose role may be to quickly try some cryptography and cryptanalysis techniques.

**Disclaimer**: the files contained herewith are clearly an implementation of **weak** cryptographic functions. Use them to try and learn as you please. **Never** use them for any serious, real-life applications!
